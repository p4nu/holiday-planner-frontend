# Holiday Planner

## Description

### The problem

* Create a tool that can calculate needed holiday days in the time period.

### The challenges

* What language to use?
    * Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, etc.
* New libraries that I have never used before (really) and needed to study a little
    * lodash
    * date-fns
    * @wojtekmaj/react-daterange-picker
* React
    * I decided to use hooks that are the future of React 🐱‍💻
    * Still learning React so this may look like it (tried my best)
    * Some problems with updating view with correct values were ordinary.

### Potential improvements

* Change to TypeScript, further abstraction
    * Interfaces and Enums without compromises
* Error messages
    * From ugly alert box to React components displaying errors in UI.

### Compromises

* JavaScript
    * Not really an OOP language, but I figured it too late 🤦‍♂️
    * Enums are not in JavaScript so made a quite near equivalent to it.
* React Hooks over Classes
    * I have not made React apps with classes, but I'm very eager to learn those too if I get in!
* Error messages
    * Quick alert boxes

## How to use this?

Run `npm install` and `npm start` in project root.
